# FRQs-2025
**My prediction of FRQs scores**

The Moment I walked out of AP CS A Exam 2025, I felt like I just spend a marathon - one, fueled with adrenaline and few frantic last minute code fixes. The FRQs were beasts of their own, tested not only your knowledge about Java coding but also your problem-solving skills under high stakes pressure. 

I think I aced few FRQs in this Exam, but some felt that I was on the edge of falling down.


There was couple of things I would need to point out:
> Exam Breakdown & Challenges
  Cypher Complexity: Some FRQs felt like solving a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded—intricate, unpredictable, and demanding precise logic.

 > Time Pressure: Balancing coding accuracy with the ticking clock added another layer of difficulty.

 > Creative Problem-Solving: While some questions played to my strengths, others required outside-the-box thinking to avoid pitfalls.

> My Performance & Prediction
 Strong Areas: Certain FRQs felt smooth, and I tackled them with confidence.
 Uncertain Sections: A few questions had me on the edge, unsure if my solutions would hold up.

Final Thoughts: My prediction? A strong score, but the final result remains to be seen. No matter the outcome, I know I gave it my all—and that’s what truly counts.
