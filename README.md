# FRQs-2025
**My prediction of FRQs scores**

The Moment I walked out of AP CS A Exam 2025, I felt like I just spend a marathon - one, fueled with adrenaline and few frantic last minute code fixes. The FRQs were beasts of their own, tested not only your knowledge about Java coding but also your problem-solving skills under high stakes pressure. 

Some questions felt like I was solving a Rubik's Cube with blindfolds.

I think I aced few FRQs in this Exam, but some felt that I was on the edge of falling down.

My prediction? I guess, overall, I am anticipating a strong score. Whether my prediction matches the reality to be seen, but one thing stays certain - I gave it my all, and that's what truly counts.
