***DOGWALKER (QUESTION 1) OVERVIEW:***

The DogWalker free-response question (FRQ) from the 2025 AP Computer Science A Exam focused on object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

🔍 Overview of the DogWalker FRQ:

🛠 Class Design: The problem involved a DogWalker class associated with a DogWalkCompany class.

🚶‍♂️ Method Implementation: Students were required to implement methods such as walkDogs(int hour), which determined how many dogs could be walked at a given time, and dogWalkShift(int startHour, int endHour), which calculated earnings based on the number of dogs walked.

📌 Key Concepts Tested:
Object-oriented principles (instance variables, constructors, method calls).
Iteration and conditional logic.
Interaction between multiple classes (DogWalker and DogWalkCompany).
